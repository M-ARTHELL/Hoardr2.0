This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About
Welcome to Hoardr 2.0! This is a Pinterest-like clone made with Next.js to allow for organizing your resources with tags instead of folders so everything is just a bit easier to find.

Hoping to handle text-based resources in the future, but for now, it is strictly image based.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Built With
* Nextjs
* NextUI
* PostgreSQL
* Prisma
* React Icons
* Over 5 years of Pinterest complaints
